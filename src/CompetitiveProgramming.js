                I start doing competitive programming since high school. I received a Bronze Medal in National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) in 2015. Then I joined the Competitive Programming Team of Zhejiang University and competed as the team leader of Team Legilimens (2017-2019) and the student co-coach (2018-2021). During my undergraduate life, I won 12 gold medals in ICPC, CCPC series competitions including the very first Regional Champion of Zhejiang University in 2017 and the Provincial Champion in 2018. On behalf of Zhejiang University, I participated in ICPC World Finals held in Beijing, 2018.
                <br /><br />
                During my first year in Georgia Tech, I won the Champion of the 2020 ICPC Southeast USA Regional Contest and Second Runner-up in the 2021 North America Championship. I will participate in ICPC World Finals 2022.
                <br /><br />
                I am International Grandmaster at Codeforces (Max Rating 2735).
